###                                              FRONT SIDE IMAGE OF THE PCB

This PCB is a relay controller board with LoRa, You can use this PCB mostly to control appliances like garage doors etc.
The Pcb uses:
1) ESP32 as the microcontroller
2) RYLR896 LoRa module.
3) OLED SSD13086 0.96' display
4) Other basic components.

There are 3 relays on board connected to pin 25/26/27 which can be customised using the selector jumpers under the ESP32 board.
